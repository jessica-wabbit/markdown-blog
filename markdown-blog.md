# Our Second Day at Epicodus

### Starring **Jessica** and **Rachel**

Today at Epicodus we learned more about using the command line, Git, GitHub, and writing markdown.

#### Our Challenges:
* Pushing to GitHub
* Learning our own initials
* How to escape a disgruntled terminal
* Git and GitHub concepts

Although we've _never_ worked together somehow we made it out alive.

#### Here are Some Tips for Getting Along with Your Partner
1. Take a break when you each need one
2.  Be Supportive
3.  Talk about your individual pairing styles up front
4.  Be patient
5.  Air out your grievances
6.  Communicate as clearly as you can
